XceedDataGridPlayground
=======================

Tiny VS2012 solution with MVVM architecture and Xceed Data Grid. It's only purpose it to provide a quick start to play around with/ evaluate the Xceed Grid.

I try to find out which features are provided by the free version of Xceed's data grid out of the box.
Currently investigated:
- Performance with ~3 Mio rows
- Multi-column grouping
- Auto-Column-width
- Data-binding "SelectedItems" to ViewModel
- Fine-tuning of keystroke-handling (e.g. go to next row on enter)

Coming soon:
- Binding VM to editing events (e.g. cancel editing from within the VM)
- Automated binding of readonly fields
- Drag & Drop behaviour
